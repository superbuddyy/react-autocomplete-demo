React Autocomplete
==================

Accessible, extensible, Autocomplete for React.js.

[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.org/reactjs/react-autocomplete.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/reactjs/react-autocomplete/)

Docs coming soon, for now just look at the `propTypes` and [examples](https://reactcommunity.org/react-autocomplete/) :)

Trying to settle on the right API, and then focus hard on accessibility,
there are a few missing bits right now.

Stuff we need help with:

- mobile support verification generally
- default mobile styles/positioniong (you'll notice the styles are
  pretty lean, on purpose, apps should style this however they'd like)
- tests (eventually)
